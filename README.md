Insights
1.  Focus sales efforts, marketing, and stock replenishment around the UK market to sustain growth and leverage its dominance.
2.  Holiday shopping seasons (Black Friday, Christmas) drive high revenue—plan campaigns, inventory, and promotions ahead of Q4.
3.   Continue prioritizing electronics. Consider reassessing fashion inventory or rebranding that category to better position it.
4.   Focus on consumer tech and premium electronics for promotional strategies. Consider bundling or upselling accessories with top devices.
5.   Return management is under control.Products with higher return rates (e.g., ZINC TOP 2 DOOR WOODEN SHELF at -40%) should be investigated for quality, size, or expectations mismatch.
6.   Customers are buying in bulk per order (average of 9 items), indicating strong cart-building behavior. You may want to introduce volume discounts or "frequently bought together" offers to boost average order value.
7. Boost inventory and advertising before Oct–Dec seasonal peak
